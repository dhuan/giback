giback

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Giback is a command-line utility for easily backing up your files to git
repositories. After setting up a configuration file listing your desired files,
and the respective target repository, you can then at any time command giback
to execute the backup.

OPTIONS
-------
-w
    Path to a workspace. Use it if you don't want your workspace to be
    "/home/user/.giback". All repositories will be kept there.

-c
    Path to a configuration file. Use it if you want a configuration file
    that's not located at the default path "/home/user/.giback.yml".

-v
    By default giback prints useful log messages describing its operations as
    it runs. It doesn't however show the output of the git command it runs.
    With this flag all git output will be visible. This is specifically useful
    for debugging.
